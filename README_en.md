## 📖 Overview

PCs, the Internet, mobile, cloud. Technology has always been mastered by the young, who drove innovation forward. Senior generations, trapped by past successes and ingrained biases, could not embrace new technologies.

With generative AI, that structure has reversed for the first time.

The quality of AI output depends on the depth of experience, knowledge, and context of the person using it. For the first time in the history of technology, the accumulation of experience directly translates into technological advantage — a singularity.

Yet the senior generation — the greatest beneficiaries — is not passing on the structure of that advantage to the next generation.

Humanity has evolved by transferring knowledge from the experienced to the young. This is a civilizational argument against the breaking of that chain in the age of AI.

This book arms the young with a "Thinking OS," confronts seniors with their responsibility,<br>and proposes a new intergenerational contract for the AI era.

## 🏗️ Structure

This book consists of a prologue, 3 parts, and an epilogue.

### Prologue: The Inconvenient Truth of the AI Era

| Theme                              | Content                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| White-collar employment collapse   | CS graduate unemployment at 6.1%, entry-level hiring down 13%. Based on Stanford research and Federal Reserve Bank of NY data |
| The illusion of blue-collar demand | "Escape to blue-collar" is not a solution. With the evolution of Physical AI, it is merely a matter of time                   |
| Conclusion                         | You cannot escape by choosing a different profession. You must change your relationship with AI                               |

### Part I: Don't Fear — Arm Yourself (A Declaration of Liberation and Methodology for the Young)

| Theme                          | Content                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A warning on mental dependency | The reality of young people consulting AI for life advice. Without your own will, not just your thinking but your emotions become dependent on AI |
| Redefining 10:80:10            | Not an efficiency framework but "the mental OS for remaining human in the AI era." First 10 = your will, 80 = AI output, last 10 = your judgment  |
| Critical thinking              | Not an efficiency technique but "a technology to protect yourself"                                                                                |
| Weapons                        | Context engineering, vibe coding — tools for empowerment, built on your own axis                                                                  |

### Part II: Demand (A Call to the Young)

| Theme                        | Content                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The theory-practice loop     | Theory alone is incomplete. Only by testing theory in practice does it become real capability. The loop between theory and practice is what builds essential competence |
| Raise your voice with intent | No one will prepare the field of practice for you. Demand it yourself                                                                                                   |

### Part III: Answer (A Warning to the Senior Generation)

| Theme                      | Content                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Recognizing responsibility | Too many adults use AI selfishly. Humanity has always passed knowledge from one generation to the next |
| Intergenerational duty     | You were raised the same way. Do not break that chain                                                  |

### Epilogue: A Declaration of Intergenerational Co-Creation

| Theme          | Content                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A new contract | The young "demand," the seniors "answer." When this bidirectional contract is fulfilled, the intergenerational gap of the AI era will close |

## 🔑 Core Framework

### 10:80:10 — The Thinking OS

The 10:80:10 framework, originally proposed as an efficiency model for new business development, is redefined in this book as "the mental OS for remaining human in the AI era."

| Phase     | Original Definition       | Redefinition in This Book                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First 10% | Problem setting           | **Your will** — What to ask, what to seek. Your axis                |
| 80%       | AI processing             | AI output — This can be delegated                                   |
| Last 10%  | Finishing the deliverable | **Judgment** — Evaluating whether AI's output aligns with your axis |

### Critical Thinking — A Technology to Protect Yourself

Not a skill for efficiency. A defense technology for maintaining your own axis against AI output.

### The Theory-Practice Loop

Theory can be learned from this book. But theory alone does not become capability. Test theory in the field of practice, then feed that experience back into theory. Only this loop builds essential competence.
